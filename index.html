                    <h3>Introduction to the Study</h3>
                    <p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide, characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. While ADHD medications have been proven effective in managing core symptoms, there has been growing concern and public debate about their effects on serious real-world outcomes beyond symptom control.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Research Gap:</strong> Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of ADHD medications for reducing symptoms, they typically have short follow-up periods (weeks to months) and exclude high-risk patients. Critical questions remain about whether these medications affect important functional outcomes such as suicidal behavior, substance misuse, accidents, and criminality—outcomes that cannot be ethically or practically studied in traditional RCTs.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why This Study Matters:</strong> This groundbreaking study uses Swedish national health registers to examine nearly 150,000 individuals with ADHD over a 2-year period, employing an innovative "target trial emulation" design that mimics a randomized trial using observational data. By analyzing real-world treatment patterns and outcomes, this research provides crucial evidence about the broader effects of ADHD medication in routine clinical practice, helping to inform treatment decisions for patients, families, and healthcare providers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Study Context:</strong> This investigation is particularly timely given the rising rates of ADHD diagnosis and medication use globally, ongoing debates about overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and the critical need for evidence on long-term functional outcomes in diverse patient populations that more accurately reflect those seen in clinical practice.</p>

                    <p>ADHD drug treatment was associated with <strong>reduced rates</strong> of first occurrence of suicidal behaviours (IRR 0.83), substance misuse (IRR 0.85), transport accidents (IRR 0.88), and criminality (IRR 0.87), but <strong>not significantly</strong> for accidental injuries (IRR 0.98). Effects were <strong>more pronounced</strong> for recurrent events, with all five outcomes showing significant reductions.</p>

                    <h3>Study Design: Target Trial Emulation</h3>
                    <p>This innovative approach mimics a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using observational data from Swedish national registers.</p>
                    
                    <div class="method-explanation">
                        <h4>🎯 What is Target Trial Emulation?</h4>
                        <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for determining whether a treatment causes an outcome. However, conducting RCTs for serious adverse outcomes like suicide, substance misuse, or criminality in ADHD patients is ethically problematic and practically infeasible. We cannot randomly assign people to take or not take medication and wait to see who attempts suicide or commits crimes.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Target trial emulation is a sophisticated methodological framework that uses observational data (from health registers, insurance claims, etc.) to emulate what would have happened if we could have ethically conducted a randomized trial. The approach involves explicitly defining a hypothetical "target trial" - specifying all design elements exactly as if we were planning an RCT - and then using statistical techniques to emulate that trial using real-world data.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Researchers first specify the protocol of the hypothetical RCT they wish they could conduct, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong> Who would be eligible? (e.g., newly diagnosed ADHD patients aged 6-64)</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment strategies:</strong> What treatments would be compared? (e.g., initiating medication vs. not initiating)</li>
                            <li><strong>Assignment procedures:</strong> When would treatment be assigned? (e.g., within 3 months of diagnosis)</li>
                            <li><strong>Follow-up period:</strong> How long would patients be followed? (e.g., 2 years)</li>
                            <li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> What would be measured? (e.g., suicidal behavior, substance misuse)</li>
                            <li><strong>Causal contrast:</strong> What effect would be estimated? (e.g., per-protocol effect of sustained treatment)</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Forces researchers to explicitly state assumptions and design choices upfront</li>
                            <li>Prevents common biases like immortal time bias (time during which events cannot occur by design)</li>
                            <li>Makes findings more comparable to RCT evidence</li>
                            <li>Allows for replication and verification by other researchers</li>
                            <li>Enables examination of questions that RCTs cannot address due to ethical or practical constraints</li>

                                <h5>Step 1: CLONING - Creating Parallel Universes</h5>
                                <p><strong>What It Means:</strong> At the moment of ADHD diagnosis (time zero), each individual is "cloned" - creating two identical copies of the same person. One clone is assigned to the "initiation" treatment strategy, and the other clone is assigned to the "non-initiation" strategy.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Why It's Necessary:</strong> In reality, we can only observe what happens to each person under the treatment they actually received. But to estimate causal effects, we need to know what <em>would have happened</em> if the same person had received the other treatment. Cloning simulates this by creating counterfactual scenarios where the same individual follows different treatment paths.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Imagine person A is diagnosed with ADHD on January 1st. At this moment:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Clone A-1</strong> is assigned to "initiation strategy": Must start medication within 3 months and stay on it</li>
                                    <li><strong>Clone A-2</strong> is assigned to "non-initiation strategy": Must never start medication</li>
                                    <li>Both clones have identical characteristics: same age, sex, psychiatric history, medical conditions, etc.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <div class="example-box">
                                    <strong>Example:</strong> If 148,581 individuals were diagnosed with ADHD, cloning creates 297,162 total observations (148,581 × 2) - essentially doubling the dataset to represent both treatment scenarios for each person.

                                <p><strong>Technical Note:</strong> This approach is based on the potential outcomes framework (Rubin's causal model), where each person has multiple potential outcomes - one for each treatment they could potentially receive. Cloning makes these potential outcomes explicit in the data structure.</p>

                                <h5>Step 2: CENSORING - Removing Protocol Deviations</h5>
                                <p><strong>What It Means:</strong> Each month during follow-up, researchers check whether each clone is still adhering to their assigned treatment strategy. If a clone deviates from their assigned protocol, they are immediately censored (removed from further follow-up).</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Why It's Necessary:</strong> In a real RCT with perfect adherence, patients in the "treatment" group would take medication continuously, and patients in the "control" group would never take it. But in observational data, people don't follow predetermined protocols - they start and stop medications based on real-world factors. If we don't account for this, we introduce "immortal time bias" and confounding by time-varying factors.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>For initiation clones:</strong> Follow-up continues as long as the person keeps taking medication (defined as having medication dispensed and no gap >90 days). If they stop medication or never start within 3 months, that clone is censored.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For non-initiation clones:</strong> Follow-up continues as long as the person does not start medication. If they start medication at any point, that clone is censored immediately before the initiation date.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monthly monitoring:</strong> Adherence is checked every month using prescription dispensing records</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <div class="example-box">
                                    <strong>Example:</strong> Person B is diagnosed with ADHD in March. Their "initiation clone" starts medication in April and takes it continuously for 8 months, then stops in December. Their "non-initiation clone" never starts medication during follow-up.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>Result:</strong> The initiation clone contributes 8 months of follow-up data (April-November), then is censored in December when treatment stops. The non-initiation clone contributes full 2-year follow-up (March-March). Any outcomes during those periods are counted for their respective strategies.

                                <p><strong>What This Prevents:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Immortal time bias:</strong> Prevents counting time before treatment starts as "treated time"</li>
                                    <li><strong>Confounding by indication:</strong> People who stop medication might do so because they're getting worse - we don't want to attribute their bad outcomes to medication</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ensures fair comparison:</strong> Only compares time periods where people are actually following their assigned protocol</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p><strong>Important Implication:</strong> This creates a per-protocol analysis (effect of sustained treatment) rather than an intention-to-treat analysis (effect of being offered treatment). The results tell us what happens if people stay on medication, not what happens if they're simply prescribed it.</p>

                                <h5>Step 3: WEIGHTING - Correcting for Selection Bias</h5>
                                <p><strong>What It Means:</strong> After censoring, the clones who remain in each treatment group may no longer be comparable - those who stay on medication might systematically differ from those who never start. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) corrects this by giving more weight to underrepresented individuals and less weight to overrepresented ones.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Why It's Necessary:</strong> Censoring is not random. People who continue medication vs. those who don't start or stop it differ in many ways:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Those staying on medication may have more severe ADHD symptoms</li>
                                    <li>They may have better access to healthcare</li>
                                    <li>They may have fewer side effects</li>
                                    <li>They may have more family support</li>
                                    <li>They may have different psychiatric comorbidities</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Without correction, we'd be comparing different types of people, not the pure effect of medication.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Predict censoring probability:</strong> Build statistical models that predict, for each person at each time point, the probability of being censored based on all measured characteristics (age, sex, psychiatric comorbidities, previous hospitalizations, medications, socioeconomic status, etc.)</li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>Calculate weights:</strong> Each person's weight = 1 / (probability of remaining uncensored). This means:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>People with low probability of remaining in their group (rare types) get high weights</li>
                                            <li>People with high probability of remaining (common types) get low weights</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    
                                    <li><strong>Apply weights in analysis:</strong> When calculating outcome rates, each person contributes their weight rather than just counting as "1". This makes the weighted sample resemble what would have happened under random assignment.</li>
                                </ol>
                                
                                <div class="example-box">
                                    <strong>Simplified Example:</strong> Suppose people with depression are more likely to stop ADHD medication (80% stop vs. 20% continue). In the uncensored "initiation" group, people with depression would be underrepresented. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Person C has depression and stays on medication (rare - only 20% do this). Their probability of not being censored = 0.2, so their weight = 1/0.2 = 5. Person C counts as "5 people" in the analysis.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Person D has no depression and stays on medication (common - 80% do this). Their probability = 0.8, so their weight = 1/0.8 = 1.25. Person D counts as "1.25 people" in the analysis.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This upweighting of Person C ensures people with depression are properly represented, as they would be if treatment assignment were random.

                                    <li><strong>Stabilized weights used:</strong> Weights are stabilized by multiplying by the marginal probability of not being censored, preventing extreme weights that could make results unstable</li>
                                    <li><strong>Time-varying weights:</strong> Weights are recalculated each month as characteristics and circumstances change</li>
                                    <li><strong>Covariates included:</strong> 50+ baseline and time-varying factors including demographics, diagnoses, medications, healthcare utilization, and socioeconomic variables</li>
                                    <li><strong>Assumption required:</strong> No unmeasured confounders - all factors affecting both censoring and outcomes must be measured (this is a strong assumption and potential limitation)</li>

                                <p><strong>What This Achieves:</strong> After weighting, the treatment groups are balanced on all measured characteristics, approximating what would have occurred under random assignment. Any remaining differences in outcomes can be more confidently attributed to the treatment itself rather than to pre-existing differences between groups.</p>

                            <h4>📊 Why This Three-Step Approach Matters</h4>
                            <p><strong>Together, these three steps create a rigorous framework that addresses fundamental challenges in causal inference from observational data:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cloning</strong> makes the target trial explicit and creates the counterfactual framework needed for causal inference</li>
                                <li><strong>Censoring</strong> ensures we're comparing apples to apples - only time periods where protocols are followed</li>
                                <li><strong>Weighting</strong> corrects for selection bias introduced by non-random censoring, making groups comparable</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>The result is an estimate of the per-protocol causal effect:</strong> What is the effect of actually taking ADHD medication continuously compared to never taking it, for patients who could plausibly follow either strategy? This is highly relevant for clinical decision-making, as it tells us what benefits patients can expect if they stay on treatment.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p class="note"><strong>Analysis type:</strong> Per-protocol effect of sustained treatment (not intention-to-treat). Results apply to patients who adhere to treatment, which is the clinically relevant question for most treatment decisions.</p>

                            <li><strong>Novel Design - Target Trial Emulation Framework:</strong> This methodological approach represents a major advance over traditional observational studies. By explicitly specifying a hypothetical randomized trial protocol and using sophisticated statistical techniques (clone-censor-weight) to emulate it, the study addresses fundamental challenges in causal inference. This framework eliminates immortal time bias (a common flaw where patients must survive long enough to receive treatment, artificially making treatment look protective), handles time-varying confounding (factors that change over time and affect both treatment and outcomes), and makes the research design transparent and replicable. The approach is increasingly recognized as the gold standard for pharmacoepidemiological studies when RCTs are not feasible.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Population-based Design with Exceptional Generalizability:</strong> Unlike clinical trials that typically exclude 50% or more of real-world patients due to strict eligibility criteria (excluding those with comorbidities, substance use, suicidality, etc.), this study includes 148,581 individuals representing the full spectrum of ADHD patients seen in routine clinical practice. The nationwide Swedish sample spans ages 6-64, includes both sexes (41.3% female), captures patients with complex comorbidities (13% had history of self-harm, 25% had substance use disorder), and represents diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. This means the findings are directly applicable to the actual patients that clinicians treat every day, not just the highly selected populations studied in clinical trials.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Data Quality and Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> Swedish national health registers are among the world's best, offering several unique advantages: (1) Universal coverage - virtually all residents are captured regardless of insurance status or ability to pay; (2) Mandatory reporting - all healthcare providers and pharmacies must report data; (3) Unique personal identification numbers allow perfect linkage across multiple registers; (4) High validity - diagnoses have 84% median positive predictive value (well-validated against medical records), death capture is >99% complete; (5) Virtually no loss to follow-up - emigration is <1% annually; (6) Prospectively collected - data recorded at time of events, not recalled retrospectively. This data quality far exceeds typical observational studies and approaches the completeness of RCTs.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Multiple Clinically Critical Outcomes:</strong> RCTs of ADHD medications typically focus on symptom rating scales (e.g., ADHD-RS) measured over weeks to months. This study addresses a critical evidence gap by examining five functional outcomes that matter most to patients and families: suicidal behavior (attempts and completions), substance misuse (abuse and dependence), accidental injuries requiring medical attention, transport accidents (a major cause of ADHD-related morbidity), and criminality (convictions for any crime). These outcomes cannot be ethically studied in RCTs, yet they are often the primary concerns of patients, families, and policymakers when making treatment decisions. By providing rigorous evidence on these outcomes, the study fills a crucial void in the evidence base.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Rigorous Statistical Methods Preventing Bias:</strong> The three-step clone-censor-weight approach is specifically designed to eliminate common sources of bias: (1) Cloning establishes clear treatment protocols and eliminates ambiguity about treatment assignment; (2) Censoring prevents immortal time bias and confounding by indication (where sicker patients receive different treatments); (3) Inverse probability weighting adjusts for 50+ measured confounders (both baseline and time-varying) to create balanced comparison groups as if treatment were randomly assigned. Additional methods strengthen causal inference: time-varying propensity scores, stabilized weights to prevent extreme values, and monthly monitoring of protocol adherence. This level of methodological rigor is rare in observational research.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Robust Sensitivity Analyses Supporting Causal Interpretation:</strong> The study includes multiple sensitivity analyses that test whether findings hold under different assumptions: (1) Negative control outcome (type 1 diabetes) - medications showed no effect on this outcome unrelated to ADHD mechanisms, suggesting findings are not due to systematic bias; (2) E-values quantify unmeasured confounding required to explain away findings - values ranged from 1.5-2.0, indicating moderate to strong robustness; (3) Different definitions of treatment initiation (1 month vs. 3 months) showed consistent results; (4) Analysis restricted to those who started treatment (on-treatment analysis) yielded similar effect sizes. The consistency across these analyses greatly strengthens confidence in the findings.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Sustained Follow-up Capturing Cumulative Effects:</strong> The 2-year observation period is substantially longer than typical ADHD medication trials (usually 3-12 weeks). This duration is critical for outcomes like substance misuse and criminality that develop over extended periods. The study design follows individuals from ADHD diagnosis through months or years of treatment exposure, capturing both immediate and delayed effects. Notably, benefits appeared stronger for recurrent events than first events, suggesting cumulative protective effects of sustained treatment - a pattern that could only be detected with extended follow-up.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Extensive Covariate Control:</strong> The inverse probability weighting included adjustment for an exceptional range of potential confounders: (1) Demographics: age, sex, calendar year; (2) Psychiatric comorbidities: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, autism, intellectual disability, conduct disorder, personality disorders, previous self-harm, previous suicide attempt; (3) Physical comorbidities: neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic pain; (4) Substance use: alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder; (5) Medications: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, opioids; (6) Healthcare utilization: previous hospitalizations, outpatient visits, emergency department visits; (7) Socioeconomic factors: parental education, family income, employment status, receipt of welfare benefits, immigrant status. This comprehensive adjustment addresses most plausible confounding pathways.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Recurrent Events Analysis - Novel Contribution:</strong> Traditional pharmacoepidemiological studies typically examine only first occurrence of outcomes. This study innovatively analyzed recurrent events (e.g., second, third suicide attempts) using Anderson-Gill models, providing insight into whether medication prevents escalation in those already experiencing problems. The finding that effects are stronger for recurrent events (e.g., 25% reduction in recurrent substance misuse and criminality vs. 13-15% for first events) has important clinical implications: medication may be particularly valuable for secondary prevention in high-risk individuals who have already experienced adverse outcomes. This represents a novel contribution to the literature.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Patient and Public Involvement:</strong> The research team collaborated with ADHD Europe, a patient advocacy organization representing individuals with lived experience of ADHD. This partnership influenced outcome selection, ensuring the study examined outcomes that matter most to patients and families rather than only outcomes convenient for researchers to measure. This patient-centered approach enhances the relevance and impact of the findings. Patient involvement is increasingly recognized as essential for producing research that truly serves patient needs.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Pre-registration and Transparency:</strong> The study protocol was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/y7fhj/) before data analysis, specifying hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans in advance. Pre-registration prevents selective reporting (only publishing positive findings), outcome switching (changing primary outcomes after seeing results), and p-hacking (trying multiple analyses until finding significant results). This practice, borrowed from clinical trials, is the gold standard for transparent research and greatly increases confidence that findings are genuine rather than artifacts of data mining.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Transparent Reporting Following Guidelines:</strong> The manuscript follows RECORD-PE (Reporting of Studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data - Pharmacoepidemiology) guidelines, ensuring comprehensive reporting of methods, data sources, assumptions, and limitations. Detailed supplement tables provide complete information about covariates, model specifications, and sensitivity analyses. This transparency allows other researchers to critically evaluate the methods, identify potential weaknesses, and replicate the analysis. It also allows clinicians to assess whether findings apply to their patient population.</li>

                        <h3>⚠ Limitations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Residual Confounding by Unmeasured Factors:</strong> Despite adjustment for 50+ measured variables, observational studies can never completely rule out confounding by unmeasured factors. Critical unmeasured confounders in this context include: (1) <strong>ADHD symptom severity</strong> - those with more severe symptoms may be more likely to start medication AND more likely to experience adverse outcomes regardless of medication; (2) <strong>Genetic factors</strong> - shared genetic risk for ADHD, substance use, and impulsivity; (3) <strong>Motivation and insight</strong> - patients who recognize their need for help and actively seek treatment may have better outcomes independent of medication; (4) <strong>Family support and home environment</strong> - strong family support may predict both medication adherence and better outcomes; (5) <strong>Cognitive function</strong> - executive function deficits may predict both treatment-seeking and adverse outcomes. The E-values (1.5-2.0) suggest unmeasured confounders would need to be moderately strong to explain away the findings, but this possibility cannot be definitively excluded. The negative control analysis (type 1 diabetes showing no association) provides some reassurance against systematic bias.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>No Data on Non-pharmacological Treatments:</strong> The comparison group represents "care as usual," which in Sweden likely includes varying degrees of psychotherapy, psychoeducation, school accommodations, occupational therapy, and parent training. The study cannot determine what proportion of the comparison group received these interventions, nor can it estimate their effects. This is problematic because: (1) If many comparison patients received effective psychotherapy, the study underestimates the true effect of medication (comparing medication vs. medication+psychotherapy vs. psychotherapy alone); (2) If those who declined medication were more likely to receive intensive psychotherapy (substitution), the comparison is confounded by treatment type; (3) Clinical guidelines recommend multimodal treatment (medication + psychotherapy), but this study cannot evaluate that approach. The estimated medication effects represent the added benefit above and beyond whatever non-pharmacological treatments patients were receiving, not the absolute effect of medication alone.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Exposure Misclassification - Dispensing vs. Consumption:</strong> The study defines medication exposure based on pharmacy dispensing records, which indicates prescription filling but not actual consumption. This creates several sources of misclassification: (1) <strong>Primary non-adherence:</strong> Some patients fill prescriptions but never take medication (estimated 10-20% for psychiatric medications); (2) <strong>Partial adherence:</strong> Patients may take medication intermittently, take lower doses than prescribed, or skip weekend doses ("drug holidays" are common for ADHD stimulants); (3) <strong>Medication sharing:</strong> Some patients may give medication to others or sell it; (4) <strong>Direction of bias uncertain:</strong> If misclassification is non-differential (random), it typically biases effects toward the null, meaning true effects might be larger than observed. However, if those who fill prescriptions but don't take medication are systematically different (e.g., more side effects, less benefit), bias direction becomes unpredictable.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>No Information on Medication Dosage:</strong> The study treats all medication exposure as equivalent, regardless of dose. This is a significant limitation because: (1) <strong>Dose-response relationships</strong> cannot be examined - higher doses may have greater benefits but also more side effects; (2) <strong>Dose titration over time</strong> is not captured - patients typically start at low doses and increase gradually; (3) <strong>Subtherapeutic dosing</strong> may be misclassified as adequate treatment; (4) <strong>Individual variation</strong> in optimal dose (based on metabolism, body weight, symptom severity) cannot be accounted for. The inability to assess dosage means the study estimates an average effect across all doses, potentially missing important nuances about optimal treatment intensity.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Per-Protocol Analysis Limits Generalizability:</strong> The analysis estimates the effect of sustained medication adherence (per-protocol effect) rather than the effect of being offered medication (intention-to-treat effect). This has important implications: (1) <strong>Excludes poor adherers:</strong> Many patients who start medication discontinue within months (30-50% in real-world studies) - the findings don't apply to them; (2) <strong>Possible collider stratification bias:</strong> Adherence itself may be affected by outcomes (e.g., patients experiencing substance misuse may stop medication), creating selection bias; (3) <strong>Overestimates population effect:</strong> If only 50% of patients prescribed medication maintain adherence, the population-level benefit is roughly half the per-protocol effect; (4) <strong>Clinical relevance unclear:</strong> While per-protocol effects tell us what happens with perfect adherence, clinicians need to know what happens when they prescribe medication to real patients with variable adherence. An intention-to-treat analysis would be more policy-relevant but methodologically challenging in this observational design.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Outcome Ascertainment - Capturing Only Severe Events:</strong> Swedish registers only capture outcomes that came to medical attention (for injuries, accidents, suicidal behavior) or legal attention (for criminality). This creates systematic underascertainment: (1) <strong>Suicidal behavior:</strong> Only captures hospitalizations and deaths, missing suicidal ideation, planning, and non-serious attempts not requiring hospitalization; (2) <strong>Substance misuse:</strong> Only captures diagnosed abuse/dependence, missing occasional use, problematic use not meeting diagnostic criteria, and cases not detected by healthcare system; (3) <strong>Accidental injuries:</strong> Only captures injuries requiring medical treatment, missing minor injuries treated at home; (4) <strong>Transport accidents:</strong> Only captures accidents reported to police or requiring medical care; (5) <strong>Criminality:</strong> Only captures convictions, missing arrests without conviction, crimes not reported to police, and illegal activities not detected. If medication affects detection rates (e.g., treated patients have more healthcare contact, leading to higher diagnosis of substance use), this could bias results.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>No Data on ADHD Presentation Subtype:</strong> ADHD has three presentations in DSM-5: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. These subtypes differ in symptom profiles, comorbidities, and possibly treatment response. The study's inability to examine subtypes means: (1) <strong>May miss differential treatment effects:</strong> Hyperactive-impulsive type might benefit more from medication for impulsivity-related outcomes (accidents, criminality) while inattentive type might benefit more for outcomes requiring sustained attention; (2) <strong>Cannot guide subtype-specific treatment decisions:</strong> Clinicians cannot use findings to determine which patients are most likely to benefit; (3) <strong>Possible confounding:</strong> If medication prescribing patterns differ by subtype (e.g., hyperactive patients more likely to receive medication) and subtypes have different baseline risks, this could confound associations.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Swedish Healthcare Context May Limit Generalizability:</strong> Sweden's healthcare system and ADHD treatment patterns differ from other countries in important ways: (1) <strong>Universal healthcare access:</strong> All residents receive care regardless of ability to pay, unlike countries with insurance-based systems; (2) <strong>Comprehensive social services:</strong> Sweden provides extensive educational support, social services, and mental health care that may not be available elsewhere; (3) <strong>Medication patterns:</strong> 88.4% received methylphenidate (a stimulant) vs. much lower rates in some countries; only 3.3% received lisdexamfetamine, which is more commonly used elsewhere; (4) <strong>Diagnostic practices:</strong> ADHD diagnosis rates, timing of diagnosis, and diagnostic criteria application may differ internationally; (5) <strong>Cultural factors:</strong> Attitudes toward medication, stigma, and treatment-seeking behavior vary across cultures. Findings may not generalize to countries with different healthcare systems, treatment availability, or cultural contexts. Replication in diverse settings is needed.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Relatively Short Follow-up Period:</strong> While 2 years is longer than most RCTs, it may be insufficient for several reasons: (1) <strong>Late-emerging outcomes:</strong> Some effects of childhood ADHD medication may not manifest until adulthood (e.g., educational attainment, occupational functioning, long-term substance dependence); (2) <strong>Cumulative effects:</strong> Protective effects may strengthen with longer treatment duration, or conversely, tolerance might develop; (3) <strong>Age-specific outcomes:</strong> Criminality, substance misuse, and suicidal behavior change with age - longer follow-up could reveal developmental patterns; (4) <strong>Treatment discontinuation effects:</strong> Unknown whether benefits persist after stopping medication or rapidly reverse (current analysis censors at discontinuation). Ideally, studies would follow patients from childhood into adulthood (10-20 years) to capture lifetime trajectories.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Selection Bias Despite Sophisticated Methods:</strong> Even with inverse probability weighting, fundamental selection bias may remain: (1) <strong>Confounding by indication:</strong> Those who start medication may differ in unmeasurable ways from those who don't - perhaps having more insight, more motivation, more engaged families, or paradoxically more severe symptoms; (2) <strong>Informative censoring:</strong> Reasons for stopping medication (side effects, lack of efficacy, improvement, worsening symptoms, substance abuse) may be related to outcomes but not fully captured by measured covariates; (3) <strong>Positivity assumption violation:</strong> Some patients may have near-zero probability of receiving treatment (or not receiving it) based on their characteristics, making comparisons unstable in those subgroups; (4) <strong>Overlap assumption:</strong> For causal inference, we need patients with similar characteristics in both treatment groups, which may not hold for extreme cases. These forms of selection bias are inherent to observational studies and cannot be fully eliminated by statistical adjustment.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Smaller Effect Sizes Than Within-Person Studies:</strong> Previous studies using within-person designs (comparing same individual during on-medication vs. off-medication periods) found larger effect sizes: 31% reduction in suicidal behavior vs. 15% in this study, 32-41% reduction in criminality vs. 25%. Several explanations are possible: (1) <strong>Selection effects:</strong> Within-person studies only include treated patients who experienced outcomes, representing a higher-risk selected population with more room for improvement; this study includes the entire ADHD population, averaging across high and low-risk individuals; (2) <strong>Different causal estimands:</strong> Within-person studies estimate immediate on-off effects, this study estimates sustained treatment effects; (3) <strong>Confounding in within-person studies:</strong> Within-person designs may have unmeasured time-varying confounding (patients may stop medication when doing well and restart when struggling), potentially inflating effects; (4) <strong>True population heterogeneity:</strong> Average treatment effects in general ADHD population may genuinely be smaller than effects in high-risk treated subgroups. The discrepancy highlights importance of clearly defining target populations and causal questions.</li>

                            <div class="quality-note"><strong>Why High:</strong> The target trial emulation framework with clone-censor-weight approach specifically addresses the most common threats to internal validity in observational research: immortal time bias (eliminated through cloning and censoring), time-varying confounding (addressed through time-varying inverse probability weights), and systematic differences between treatment groups (balanced through extensive covariate adjustment). The study adjusted for 50+ baseline and time-varying confounders. Multiple sensitivity analyses support robustness: E-values of 1.5-2.0 indicate moderate robustness to unmeasured confounding, negative control outcome (type 1 diabetes) showed no association as expected, and findings were consistent across different analytical approaches. <strong>Why Not Higher:</strong> As with all observational studies, unmeasured confounding cannot be completely ruled out. Key unmeasured factors include ADHD severity (symptoms not captured in registers), motivation to seek treatment, genetic predisposition to impulsivity, and family support - any of which could partially explain observed associations. The study cannot achieve the certainty of a well-conducted RCT, but represents the strongest observational design currently available for this research question.</div>

                            <div class="quality-note"><strong>Why High:</strong> Unlike RCTs that typically exclude 50% or more of potential participants, this population-based study includes nearly all individuals diagnosed with ADHD in Sweden (2007-2020), representing routine clinical practice. The sample includes: broad age range (6-64 years, median 17.4), both sexes (41.3% female), patients with complex psychiatric comorbidities (25% substance use disorder, 13% self-harm history, 15% anxiety/depression), diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, and both stimulant (88.4% methylphenidate) and non-stimulant medications. Follow-up occurred in real-world settings with variable adherence, making findings directly applicable to clinical practice. <strong>Potential Limitations:</strong> Generalizability to non-Swedish populations is uncertain. Sweden's universal healthcare system ensures treatment access regardless of ability to pay, comprehensive social services may modify treatment effects, and medication prescribing patterns (very high methylphenidate use) differ from many other countries. Cultural attitudes toward medication and psychiatric treatment also vary internationally. Replication in diverse healthcare systems and cultural contexts would strengthen confidence in generalizability.</div>

                            <div class="quality-note"><strong>Why High:</strong> The massive sample size (148,581 individuals followed for up to 2 years, generating approximately 200,000 person-years of observation) provides exceptional statistical power to detect even small effects with high precision. Confidence intervals are narrow for all outcomes (e.g., suicidal behavior IRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.88), indicating precise effect estimates. The study had adequate power for multiple subgroup analyses (by age, sex, medication type, prior event history) and sensitivity analyses. Even rare outcomes like completed suicide (n=99 deaths) had sufficient events for analysis. <strong>Statistical Challenges:</strong> Despite large overall sample, some subgroup analyses (e.g., specific age groups, specific medication types) had wider confidence intervals. The complexity of inverse probability weighting can increase standard errors, though stabilized weights were used to minimize this. Multiple testing across five primary outcomes and numerous subgroups raises possibility of false positives, though consistency of findings and pre-specified hypotheses mitigate this concern.</div>

                            <div class="quality-note"><strong>Why Moderate (Not Low):</strong> Several sources of bias remain despite rigorous methods: (1) <strong>Selection bias:</strong> Treatment assignment was not random - systematic differences between those who start medication vs. those who don't may persist despite weighting; (2) <strong>Measurement bias:</strong> Outcomes ascertained through registers capture only events severe enough for medical/legal attention, potentially missing milder cases; medication exposure based on dispensing not consumption; (3) <strong>Confounding by indication:</strong> Despite adjusting for 50+ factors, unmeasured confounders (ADHD severity, motivation, family support, genetic factors) could partially explain associations; (4) <strong>Informative censoring:</strong> Reasons for stopping medication may be related to outcomes in ways not fully captured by weights. <strong>Why Not High Risk:</strong> The sophisticated analytical approach addresses most major bias sources more thoroughly than typical observational studies. Multiple sensitivity analyses support findings' robustness. Negative control analysis provides evidence against gross systematic bias. Effect consistency across outcomes and subgroups reduces plausibility of bias explanations. Overall, bias likely explains only a portion of observed effects, not all.</div>

                            <div class="quality-note"><strong>Why Very High:</strong> This study addresses one of the most pressing questions in ADHD treatment: whether medications affect serious real-world outcomes beyond symptom control. The outcomes studied - suicidal behavior, substance misuse, accidents, and criminality - are exactly what patients, families, and clinicians worry about most when making treatment decisions. Current clinical guidelines are based primarily on symptom reduction RCTs; this study provides critically needed evidence on functional outcomes. The findings directly inform: (1) Patient-clinician shared decision-making conversations; (2) Treatment guidelines and recommendations; (3) Health policy debates about ADHD medication access and insurance coverage; (4) Public discourse about rising ADHD diagnosis and treatment rates. <strong>Practical Impact:</strong> Effect sizes are modest but clinically meaningful - 13-17% reductions in serious adverse outcomes at population level represent thousands of events prevented annually. Stronger effects in high-risk subgroups (21% reduction in suicide attempts among those with prior attempts) identify patients who may benefit most. The study transforms ADHD treatment discussion from "Does medication improve symptom scores?" to "Does medication reduce risk of suicide, addiction, and incarceration?" - a much more meaningful question for real-world decision-making.</div>

                            <div class="quality-note"><strong>Synthesis:</strong> This represents one of the highest-quality observational studies in ADHD pharmacoepidemiology. The target trial emulation framework is methodologically sophisticated and specifically designed to address limitations of traditional observational designs. Data quality from Swedish registers is exceptional. Sample size provides excellent power and precision. Outcomes are clinically critical and previously understudied. Transparency through pre-registration and detailed reporting allows critical appraisal and replication. Multiple sensitivity analyses support robustness. <strong>Appropriate Caveats:</strong> As an observational study, it cannot achieve the certainty of a well-conducted RCT for causal inference. Residual confounding and selection bias remain possible. Generalizability beyond Sweden requires replication. <strong>Where This Fits in Evidence Hierarchy:</strong> Below large, well-conducted RCTs with low risk of bias, but above most observational cohort studies. For questions that cannot be answered by RCTs (like this one), target trial emulation represents the strongest available approach. The study should be weighted heavily in evidence synthesis and guideline development, while acknowledging the inherent limitations of observational research.</div>

                            <h4>🤔 Why the Difference? Understanding Study Design Impact</h4>
                            
                            <p><strong>1. Different Target Populations - Selection Effects</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Within-person studies</strong> compare the same individuals during periods when they are taking medication vs. not taking medication. By design, these studies only include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Patients who were prescribed and took ADHD medication at some point</li>
                                <li>Patients who experienced at least one adverse outcome (otherwise they wouldn't be in the analysis)</li>
                                <li>Patients with variable medication use (must have both on and off periods)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This creates a highly selected, high-risk population. For example, within-person criminality studies only include ADHD patients who committed crimes - a subset representing perhaps 10-30% of all ADHD patients.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>This target trial emulation study</strong> includes the entire ADHD population diagnosed during the study period (148,581 individuals), averaging across:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Those who will and won't experience adverse outcomes</li>
                                <li>Those at high and low baseline risk</li>
                                <li>Those with severe and mild ADHD symptoms</li>
                                <li>Those with and without psychiatric comorbidities</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Imagine medication reduces criminality by 40% in high-risk individuals (top 20% of risk distribution) but has no effect in low-risk individuals (bottom 80%). Within-person studies would detect the 40% reduction because they only include those who committed crimes (high-risk group). Population-based studies would detect a much smaller average effect (~8% = 0.4 × 0.2) because most people are low-risk. Both findings are "correct" - they just answer different questions.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>2. Different Causal Questions - Sustained vs. Intermittent Effects</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Within-person studies</strong> estimate the immediate on-off effect: What happens when the same person goes from taking medication to not taking it (or vice versa)? This captures short-term effects of having medication in your system.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>This study</strong> estimates the sustained treatment effect: What happens if someone consistently takes medication for months/years compared to never taking it? This captures cumulative effects of long-term treatment adherence.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> These may genuinely differ. Acute medication effects (improved attention, reduced impulsivity) might produce large short-term reductions in outcomes. But sustained effects might be smaller if: (1) Tolerance develops over time; (2) Behavioral compensations emerge during off-periods; (3) Environmental changes (supportive interventions, maturation) accumulate over time independent of medication. Conversely, sustained effects could be larger if cumulative benefits accrue (e.g., better education, stable employment, social relationships). The evidence here suggests acute effects may be stronger.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>3. Methodological Differences - Confounding Patterns</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Within-person confounding:</strong> These studies face time-varying confounding - factors that change over time and affect both medication use and outcomes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Symptom-driven discontinuation:</strong> Patients may stop medication when feeling better (symptoms improved) and restart when struggling. This creates confounding where "off periods" occur during naturally better times.</li>
                                <li><strong>Crisis-driven initiation:</strong> Patients may start medication after a crisis (suicide attempt, arrest), creating confounding where "on periods" occur during naturally worse times.</li>
                                <li><strong>Seasonal patterns:</strong> Medication use often decreases during summer breaks when symptoms matter less, potentially conflating medication effects with seasonal patterns in outcomes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This time-varying confounding could inflate apparent medication benefits if not properly addressed (though sophisticated within-person studies do attempt to control for this).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Between-person confounding:</strong> This study faces selection bias - systematic differences between those who start vs. don't start medication:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Those starting medication may have more severe symptoms (worse outcomes expected)</li>
                                <li>Or may have more insight/motivation (better outcomes expected)</li>
                                <li>Or may have better healthcare access (better outcomes expected)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Despite extensive adjustment and weighting, residual confounding could remain, potentially underestimating true effects if unmeasured confounders make treated patients appear higher-risk.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>4. Which Findings Are "Right"? Implications for Practice</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Both sets of findings can be simultaneously true - they answer different questions for different populations:</strong></p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Within-person studies tell us:</strong> "For ADHD patients who have already experienced adverse outcomes (suicide attempts, arrests, etc.), being on medication vs. off medication reduces their risk of recurrence by ~30-40%." This is highly relevant for secondary prevention - treating high-risk individuals to prevent escalation.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>This population study tells us:</strong> "For the general population of ADHD patients (most of whom will never experience these adverse outcomes), sustained medication treatment reduces risk by ~15-25% on average." This is relevant for primary prevention - deciding whether to start medication in newly diagnosed patients.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>For clinical practice:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>When counseling newly diagnosed patients with no adverse event history:</strong> Use population estimates (15-25% risk reduction) - these patients resemble the general ADHD population</li>
                                <li><strong>When counseling patients with history of suicide attempts, substance abuse, or criminality:</strong> Use within-person estimates (30-40% risk reduction) - these patients resemble the high-risk selected populations in within-person studies</li>
                                <li><strong>For policy decisions about population-level medication access:</strong> Use population estimates - they represent average effects across all treated patients</li>
                                <li><strong>For discussions about acute crisis management:</strong> Within-person immediate on-off effects may be more relevant</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>Appropriate Clinical Messaging:</strong> "ADHD medication provides modest but meaningful protection against serious adverse outcomes for the average patient (15-25% reduction). However, if you've already experienced suicide attempts, substance problems, or legal issues, the protective effect appears substantially stronger (30-40% reduction), making medication particularly important for preventing recurrence."</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p class="interpretation"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The smaller effect sizes in this population-based study do not invalidate previous within-person findings. Rather, they provide complementary information about average treatment effects in the general ADHD population. The convergence of evidence from different methodologies, despite different effect magnitudes, strengthens confidence that ADHD medication does reduce risk of serious adverse outcomes. The magnitude of benefit likely varies substantially across individuals based on their baseline risk profile.</p>

                    <h3>Clinical Significance vs. Statistical Significance: What Do These Effects Mean in Practice?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Statistical significance</strong> tells us whether an effect is likely real (not due to chance). <strong>Clinical significance</strong> tells us whether the effect is large enough to matter for patient care and decision-making. Most findings in this study are statistically significant (p < 0.05), meaning we can be confident the effects are real. But are they clinically meaningful? This requires contextual interpretation.</p>

                            <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Among ADHD patients who have already experienced substance misuse, staying on medication reduces risk of subsequent episodes by 25%</li>
                            <li><strong>Why highly significant:</strong> Substance use disorders are devastating, leading to addiction, overdose, loss of employment, family breakdown, and death. A 25% reduction is substantial for such serious outcomes</li>
                            <li><strong>Numbers needed to treat (NNT):</strong> Approximately 6-8 patients with substance misuse history would need sustained medication treatment for 2 years to prevent one recurrent substance misuse event</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical context:</strong> Many existing interventions for substance use (counseling, support groups) show 10-20% effectiveness, so 25% is competitive with established treatments</li>

                            <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Among ADHD patients with criminal history, staying on medication reduces risk of reoffending by 25%</li>
                            <li><strong>Why highly significant:</strong> Criminality leads to incarceration, criminal records affecting employment, family separation, and substantial societal costs. Even modest reductions have major individual and societal value</li>
                            <li><strong>Public health impact:</strong> Given ~10-30% of ADHD individuals experience criminality, population-level effects could prevent thousands of offenses annually in a country like Sweden</li>

                            <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Medication reduces risk of suicide attempts and deaths by about 15-17%</li>
                            <li><strong>Why moderately significant:</strong> Suicide is the most severe possible outcome (death or severe injury). Even modest reductions are profoundly meaningful. However, absolute risk reduction is relatively small because baseline suicide rate is low (14.5 per 1000 person-years in treated group)</li>
                            <li><strong>Numbers needed to treat (NNT):</strong> Approximately 200-250 patients would need treatment for 2 years to prevent one suicide attempt. This may seem high, but given the severity of the outcome (death or serious injury), this is considered worthwhile</li>
                            <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Many accepted suicide prevention interventions show similar or smaller effect sizes. For instance, antidepressants in youth show ~5-10% reduction in suicidal ideation in trials</li>
                            <li><strong>Stronger in high-risk group:</strong> 21% reduction (IRR 0.79) in those with previous suicide attempts - NNT improves to ~50-75, making this highly clinically significant for secondary prevention</li>

                            <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Medication reduces risk of traffic accidents and other transport-related injuries by 12-16%</li>
                            <li><strong>Why moderately significant:</strong> Transport accidents are a leading cause of injury and death, particularly in young adults with ADHD. Driving impairments in ADHD are well-documented (increased crash rates, traffic violations). A 12-16% reduction represents substantial public safety benefit</li>
                            <li><strong>Context:</strong> ADHD patients have 20-50% higher accident rates than general population; medication brings risk closer to population norms</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic impact:</strong> Average cost of a serious traffic accident is $50,000-100,000 (medical care, vehicle damage, lost productivity)</li>

                        <p><strong>No significant effect on first accidental injuries (IRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.01); 4% reduction in recurrent injuries (IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.98)</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>What this means:</strong> Medication shows no clear effect on first-time injuries but small (4%) reduction in recurrent injuries among those with injury history</li>
                            <li><strong>Why the minimal effect?</strong> Several explanations: (1) Accidental injuries are very common (88.5 per 1000 person-years) and heterogeneous (sports injuries, falls, burns, etc.) - many unrelated to ADHD impulsivity; (2) Some injuries occur despite medication due to situational factors; (3) Effects may be diluted across diverse injury types; (4) Children with ADHD may have increased activity/risk-taking even with medication</li>
                            <li><strong>Why still meaningful:</strong> High baseline prevalence means even 4% reduction affects many people. In a population of 100,000 ADHD patients, 4% reduction prevents ~350 injury events per year. At population level, this has public health value</li>
                            <li><strong>Individual counseling:</strong> For an individual patient deciding about medication, injury prevention alone would not be a compelling reason.

                        <h4>🔍 Interpreting "Modest" Effects: Why They Matter</h4>
                        <p><strong>When evaluating clinical significance, consider multiple factors:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Severity of Outcome:</strong> Even small effects on severe outcomes (death, addiction) are clinically important. A 15% reduction in suicide is more meaningful than 50% reduction in headaches.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. Baseline Risk:</strong> High prevalence outcomes (accidental injuries at 88.5/1000) mean small effect sizes affect many people. Low prevalence outcomes (suicide at 14.5/1000) mean even large effect sizes prevent relatively few events.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>3. Alternative Interventions:</strong> How do medication effects compare to alternatives? For many ADHD-related outcomes, no other intervention shows superior effectiveness. Medication represents best available option.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>4. Cumulative Benefits:</strong> Medication doesn't just prevent one outcome - it reduces risk across multiple domains simultaneously (symptoms + suicide + substance use + accidents + criminality). Combined benefits exceed any single effect.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>5. Sustained Effect:</strong> Benefits accumulate over years. A 15% annual risk reduction compounds over 10 years to substantial cumulative benefit.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>6. Patient Preferences:</strong> Some patients prioritize avoiding specific outcomes (e.g., "I'm most worried about substance abuse in my teenager"). Even modest effects on patient-prioritized outcomes have high value.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>7. Side Effect Profile:</strong> Clinical significance is always relative to harms. ADHD medications have generally manageable side effects (appetite suppression, sleep problems, increased heart rate) that are often temporary. Benefit-risk ratio remains favorable even for modest benefits.</p>

                        <h4>💡 Bottom Line for Clinical Practice</h4>
                        <p><strong>How to discuss these findings with patients:</strong></p>
                        <p>"ADHD medication has been proven to improve symptoms, but we now have strong evidence it also reduces risk of serious real-world problems. On average, medication reduces your risk of suicide attempts by about 15-17%, substance abuse by 15-25%, car accidents by 12-16%, and criminal involvement by 13-25%. These aren't huge reductions, but they're meaningful - similar to or better than many other preventive treatments we recommend. The effects appear stronger if you've already experienced these problems in the past. Combined with symptom improvement and relatively manageable side effects, medication offers worthwhile protection for most people with ADHD."</p>

                    <h3>💡 Key Takeaway</h3>
                    <p>This rigorous population-based study provides the strongest evidence to date that ADHD medication treatment in routine clinical practice is associated with reduced risks of serious adverse outcomes including suicidal behaviour, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminality. While effect sizes are modest and limitations exist, the findings address critical gaps in RCT literature and provide valuable real-world evidence to inform treatment decisions for the diverse ADHD population seen in clinical practice.</p>
